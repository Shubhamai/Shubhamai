Well, I love robotics and how Machine Learning & AI can be applied to this thing, always seek to learn new stuff from quantum computing, spaceðŸŒŒ, robotics ðŸ¤– to the latest research in AI.   


I have been Machine learning since more than a year, and currently, making all sorts of projects and products with Machine learning, Deep Learning, computer vision, Deep Reinforcement Learning and possibly Natural Language Processing, and of course, deploying them into the cloud for the world

I started programming way back when I was 14, playing with electronics and micro-controllers including Arduino, Raspberry PI, servo, LED ðŸ’¡, and much more. Then it was time to upgrade, so I started learning Python and there was a lot of fun to learn a new programming language, I started learning Machine Learning way back when I was 15 years old, with Deep Learning, Computer Vision, Natural Language Processing and little Reinforcement Learning.

Currently, I have been working as a Freelancer and Teaching Assistant at [Zero to Mastery](http://zerotomastery.io/).  Helping students who are just getting started into Machine Learning & AI.



My current goals are to learn the latest advancement in Machine Learning and learn Deep Reinforcement Learning at the end of this year.


My stuff & works is all around here and there in this Website.

India is my home country and i am proud of that.
